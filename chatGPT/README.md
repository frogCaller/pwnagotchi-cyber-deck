# Fun Additions

Level up your Raspberry Pi experience with a touch of fun and advanced capabilities! First, indulge in a collection of entertaining commands by installing fortune, lolcat, cmatrix, hollywood, and cowsay with a simple 'sudo apt install' command. Then, take your Raspberry Pi to the next level by installing chatGPT for engaging conversations.
## **Installations**

1. **Install some typical fun command:**
    ```
   sudo apt install fortune lolcat cmatrix hollywood cowsay -y
   ```

2. **Install chatGPT on your Raspberry Pi 4/5:**<br />
   
   Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/antimatter15/alpaca.cpp.git
   cd alpaca.cpp
   sudo make chat
   wget https://huggingface.co/Sosaka/Alpaca-native-4bit-ggml/resolve/main/ggml-alpaca-7b-q4.bin
   ```   
   To use, run:
   ```
   ./chat
   ```
    > *For an optimal experience, I highly recommend using a standard computer running Ubuntu and following the same stepsâ€” the difference in performance will be noticeably significant compared to running it on a Raspberry Pi.*
